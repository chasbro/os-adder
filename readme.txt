Add the operating-system's abbraviation ("win", "mac", "linux") as a CSS-Class to the body-tag.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a abbreviation of the operating system (win, mac, linux) to the body-tag.
So if there's a OS-difference, you can easily react to it by using the selector (e.g. .mac).

Next steps of this plugin:
* adding a settings page 
* add the class to specified elements
* add user-language-abbreviation to specified elements

let me know, if you wish something helpful.
